Using perlbrew with Perl version 5.30.2.

Run script:
    perl get-beers.pl <min_abv> <max_abv>

I spent too long trying to get the request to work in my script; I eventually learnt that 'User-Agent' => 'curl/7.68.0' gave me permission to access the URL.

I would like to have split some of the code into a package and written tests for it.

The script also lacks a lot of error handling (e.g. what if no arguments provided?)

I didn't have time to group beers by their yeast.
