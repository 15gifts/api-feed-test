# A simple Node CLI command

NOTE: It does say to store the json results, but I forgot and now I'm getting 429, so sorting by yeast is due, but no time left

## How to use and install

1. Clone the repo
2. Open a terminal in the `beer-cli` folder
3. Type `npm install` so all necessary modules will be added
4. Type `npm install -g .` so then you can run the command in terminal by typing `beer`
5. In a terminal, type `beer <min> <max>` where min and max should be numbers
